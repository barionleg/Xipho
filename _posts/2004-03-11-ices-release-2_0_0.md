After far too long in development and testing, the icecast development team has
released Ices version 2.0.0. Ices is a source client for Icecast streaming media
server. It takes audio from one of the defined inputs and (re)encodes the audio
for streaming to icecast for listeners to pick up.  
  
Download Ices 2.0.0 from the [Ices page]({{ "/ices" | prepend: site.baseurl }}).
