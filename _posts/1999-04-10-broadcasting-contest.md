Well I've been thinking about running a contest for a long time now, and here's the idea: I
will offer broadcasting space on my machine (which is connected on a very high speed connection)
to the top 5 broadcasters from this contest. I haven't worked out the details, but the idea is to
have some period of time for which anyone can try out their djing skills, and then based on listener
feedback and number of listeners, we'll choose the top 5 (or some other number) of broadcasters and
offer them space to broadcast from. So anyone out there is eligible for this - and I encourage those
who don't have the ability to broadcast now to apply!
