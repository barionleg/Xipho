After quite a while without a release, we are happy to announce the release
of Ices 2.0.3!

Ices is a source client for the Icecast streaming media server, it takes audio
from one of the defined inputs and (re)encodes the audio for streaming.

- New features:
  * Support for m3u and VCLT playlists
  * Support for TLS
  * Support for Ogg/Opus, Ogg/Speex, and Ogg/FLAC (without transcoding support)
  * Support to run a command after a track finished
- Fixes:
  * Improved shuffling for playlists
  * Several fixes, code improvements, and hardening
  * Updates to the build system
  * Updates and improvements to the documentation

  
Download Ices 2.0.3 from the [Ices page]({{ "/ices" | prepend: site.baseurl }}).
