Based on the great feedback we got from the comunity we proudly release a new version fixing the last release.

This fix includes:

- Fix a compilation error (No rule to make target 'libshout.chkport'), ref [#2235]
- Fix a little problem with build env checks on some targets

Download libshout 2.4.1 from the [download page]({{ "/download" | prepend: site.baseurl }}).

[#2235]: https://trac.xiph.org/ticket/2235
