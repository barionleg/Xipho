After years in development and years in alpha testing, the Icecast development team
has released version 2.0.0 of its streaming media server. Icecast2 supports Ogg Vorbis
and MP3 streaming and has many features and functions you would expect from a world
class streaming media server.  
  
There are more things to come from the icecast development team, and we have many new
features just waiting to be implemented.  
  
Download 2.0.0 from the main [download page]({{ "/download" | prepend: site.baseurl }}).  
  
In addition to the new release, we have re-vamped the icecast.org website to hopefully
make things easier to access and to get at the information you need faster.
Please let us know what you think.
