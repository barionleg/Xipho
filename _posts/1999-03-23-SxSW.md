SxSW was awesome. I got to meet a lot of artists and small labels, and I had some really
interesting conversations with some really interesting people. The [Green Witch](https://web.archive.org/web/19991005001058/http://207.181.249.18/) received a
lot of new content and we broadcasted a lot of it live from the floor.
In other news, 1.3 is coming along quite nicely, and maybe we'll have something out there
for you to yell at us about any day now. :)
