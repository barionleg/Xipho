We are happy to announce the first public release of libigloo.

libigloo is a our new generic C framework. It should replace
the code our existing projects share currently (known as "common/")
over the time. It will both provide a more uniform as well as clean,
and modern interface to our shared code base.

This first release includes support for object and memory management
as well as set of utility functions. More to come with next release!

Download libigloo 0.9.0 from the [download page]({{ "/download" | prepend: site.baseurl }}).
