Right now Jack has finished up a day at [South by Southwest](https://web.archive.org/web/19990504185130/http://sxsw.com/)
in Austin, Texas.
He's there presenting with the folks from the [GreenWitch](https://web.archive.org/web/19990508212821/http://www.greenwitch.com/) who were generous
in sharing booth space with us.
Hopefully we'll have some reports back from him soon.
