# Mailing List
The Icecast Mailing Lists (and their archives) are one of the first places to
check for questions that may have been answered in the past.

We have two mailing lists devoted to Icecast:

-   icecast: The `[icecast]` mailing list is appropriate for general icecast usage questions.
-   icecast-dev: The `[icecast-dev]` mailing list is reserved for any developer related questions.

To sign up for each this mailing list, simply send an e-mail to [icecast-request@xiph.org](mailto:icecast-request@xiph.org)
or [icecast-dev-request@xiph.org](mailto:icecast-dev-request@xiph.org) and include the text `subscribe` in the message.

Then simply follow the directions from there.

More details as well as access to the web-accessible archives of the mailing lists can be
found [here](http://lists.xiph.org/mailman/listinfo/icecast) (for the icecast list) and
[here](http://lists.xiph.org/mailman/listinfo/icecast-dev) (for the icecast-dev list).
