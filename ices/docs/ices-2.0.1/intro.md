# What is IceS?
IceS is a source client for a streaming server. The purpose of this client is to provide an audio stream to a streaming server such that one or more listeners can access the stream. With this layout, this source client can be situated remotely from the icecast server.  
  
The primary example of a streaming server used is Icecast 2, although others could be used if certain conditions are met.
