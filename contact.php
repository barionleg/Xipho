<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<p>There are many ways to get a hold of someone from the icecast project, here are a few</p>

<h5>The Mailing List</h5>

<p>The Icecast <a href="mailinglist.php">Mailing Lists</a> (and their archives) are one of the first places to check for questions that may have been answered in the past.</p>

<h5>IRC</h5>
<p>IRC is potentially the fastest way to get an answer, if you're lucky. Our official channel is #icecast on irc.freenode.net.</p>

<h5>E-mail</h5>
<p>We have a few mailslots if you would rather use plain ol email: </p>

<pre>
webmaster@xiph.org 
</pre>

<p>Email the webmaster if you notice a broken link, outdated or inaccurate information, or another flaw on icecast.org.</p>
