version: 2.4.0

<article markdown="1">
The Win32 port of Icecast 2 is a simple command line application,
it used to be a UI framework around the core Icecast 2 server.  
  
Most of the features of Icecast 2 are available in the Win32 port.  
__A notable absence is IPv6 support.__
  
If there is sufficient user interest we may reintroduce the Icecast GUI
and capability to start Icecast as a Windows Service.
