The Win32 port of Icecast 2 is a simple command line application,
it used to be a UI framework around the core Icecast 2 server.  

The GUI is no longer necessary as Icecast has achieved all of its 
functionality in its web interface.
  
Most of the features of Icecast 2 are available in the Win32 port.  
__A notable absence is IPv6 support.__
  
We are planning to reintroduce the capability to start Icecast 
as a Windows Service in the 2.5.0 release.
