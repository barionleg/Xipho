# Listener Authentication
Listener authentication is a feature of Icecast which allows you to secure a certain mountpoint such that in order to listen,
a listener must pass some verification test. With this feature, a simple pay-for-play operation (eg. user/pass), or some filtering
based on the listener connection can be performed. This section will show you the basics of setting up and maintaining this component.  
  
To define listener authentication, a group of tags are specified in the `<mount>` group relating to the mountpoint. This means
that authentication can apply to listeners of source clients or relays.  
  
The following authentication mechanisms can apply to listeners:

*	htpasswd: lookup a named file for a matching username and password
*	URL: issue web requests (eg. PHP) to match authentication

The listener authentication within a specified mount in the icecast XML configuration can apply to either to a stream from a
source client, relay or a webroot based file. They do apply to intro files or fallback streams.

# htpasswd Listener Authentication
In order to use listener authentication, you __must__ configure a mount specific option. This means that you have to provide
a `<mount>` section in the main icecast config file. The following is an example:

{% highlight xml %}
<mount>
	<mount-name>/example.ogg</mount-name>
	<authentication type="htpasswd">
		<option name="filename" value="myauth"/>
		<option name="allow_duplicate_users" value="0"/>
	</authentication>
</mount>
{% endhighlight %}

To support listener authentication you __must__ provide at a minimum `<mount-name>` and `<authentication>`.  
The `mount-name` is the name of the mountpoint that you will use to connect your source client with and `authentication` configures
what type of Icecast authenticator to use.  
Currently, only `htpasswd` and `url` are implemented. Each authenticator has a variable number of options that are required and
these are specified as shown in the example.  
The htpasswd authenticator requires a few parameters:  
The first, `filename`, specifies the name of the file to use to store users and passwords. Note that this file need not exist
(and probably will not exist when you first set it up).  
Icecast has built-in support for managing users and passwords via the web admin interface. More on this later in this section.  
The second option, `allow_duplicate_users`, if set to `0`, will prevent multiple connections using the same username. Setting this
value to `1` will enable mutltiple connections from the same username on a given mountpoint.  
Note there is no way to specify a “max connections” for a particular user.  
  
Icecast supports a mixture of streams that require listener authentication and those that do not.

## Configuring Users and Passwords
Once the appropriate entries are made to the config file, connect your source client (using the mountpoint you named in
the config file). To configure users and passwords for this stream you must use the web-based admin interface. Navigate to
`http://server:ip/admin/stats.xsl` to begin. If you have configured everything properly, you should see a screen like the
following:

![Screenshot of Admin Stats](img/listener_auth1.png)

You will see a lock in front of all mountpoint configured for listener authentication. Also note that this page will
only show _connected_ mountpoints.

To manage users and passwords for this mountpoint, click on the “Manage Authentication” link. The following screen will be shown:

![Screenshot of Manage Authentication](img/listener_auth2.png)

This screen will show all the users configured for this mountpoint. Adding users is as simple as entering a username and password
in the fields and clicking “Add”.  
Note that usernames __must__ be unique and there are __no__ restrictions on passwords. You can delete users by clicking the appropriate
delete link next to each user.

## Finishing it all off
Ok, so you've created your users, and you have everything setup properly, how do your users login? Well, we've provided a simple login
form that you can use for this purpose. This page (`http://server:port/auth.xsl`) will bring up a form that users can use to enter their
username and password.

This page will serve a m3u with the username and password and in most cases should open the correct media player and begin playing
your stream.

# URL

Authenticating listeners via the URL method involves Icecast, when a listener connects, issuing requests to a web server
and checking the response headers. If a certain header is sent back then the listener connecting is allowed to continue,
if not, an error is sent back to the listener.  
  
The URLs specified will invoke some web server scripts like PHP to do any work that they may choose to do. All that is
required of the scripting language is that POST information can be handled and response headers can be sent back.  
libcurl is used for the requesting so https connections may be possible, but be aware of the extra overhead involved.  
  
The useragent sent in each curl request will represent the Icecast server version. The response headers will depend on
whether the listener is to be accepted. In the case of rejection, a response header  
`Icecast-Auth-Message: Reason`  
should also be returned for placing in the log files.  
  
In order to use URL based listener authentication, you __must__ configure a mount specific option. This means that you
have to provide a `<mount>` section in the main Icecast config file. The following shows the list of options available:  

{% highlight xml %}
<mount>
    <mount-name>/example.ogg</mount-name>
    <authentication type="url">
    	<option name="mount_add" value="http://auth.example.org/stream_start.php"/>
        <option name="mount_remove" value="http://auth.example.org/stream_end.php"/>
        <option name="listener_add" value="http://auth.example.org/listener_joined.php"/>
        <option name="listener_remove" value="http://auth.example.org/listener_left.php"/>
        <option name="username" value="user"/>
        <option name="password" value="pass"/>
        <option name="auth_header" value="icecast-auth-user: 1"/>
        <option name="timelimit_header" value="icecast-auth-timelimit:"/>
        <option name="headers" value="x-pragma,x-token"/>
        <option name="header_prefix" value="ClientHeader."/>
        <option name="stream_auth" value="http://auth.example.org/source.php"/>
    </authentication>
</mount>
{% endhighlight %}

The options are described below in more detail, each of which is optional, but in each case, within the POST data,
the value for each setting is encoded.


## mount_add

This URL is for informing the auth server of a stream starting. No listener information is passed for this,
but it can be used to initialise any details the auth server may have.  

### POST Details
action
: `mount_add`

mount
: the mountpoint starting up

server
: the server name (`<hostname>`)

port
: the server port

### Example
`action=mount_add&mount=/live&server=icecast.example.org&port=8000`


## mount_remove
This URL is for informing the auth server of a stream finishing, like the start option, no listener details
are passed.  

### POST Details
action
: `mount_remove`

mount
: the mountpoint being removed

server
: the server name (`<hostname>`)

port
: the server port

### Example
`action=mount_remove&mount=/live&server=icecast.example.org&port=8000`


## listener_add
This is most likely to be used if anything. When a listener connects, before anything is sent back to them, this
request is processed. The default action is to reject a listener unless the auth server sends back a response header
which may be stated in the `header` option.

### POST Details
action
: `listener_add`

mount
: the mountpoint, including query parameters

server
: the server name (`<hostname>`)

port
: the server port

user
: user as stated in listener HTTP basic auth  
  _May be blank_

pass
: pass as stated in listener HTTP basic auth
  _May be blank_

client
: unique ID for the client within Icecast

ip
: listeners IP address

agent
: useragent from the listeners player

__Note:__ The mount here (unlike the start/end options) states the requested url including any query parameters,
so for instance the requested URL can be `/stream.ogg&session=xyz`, but note that each option data is
escaped before being passed via POST.

### Example
`action=listener_add&server=icecast.example.org&port=8000&client=1&mount=/live&user=&pass=&ip=127.0.0.1&agent=My%20player`  


## listener_remove
This URL is for when a listener connection closes.

### POST Details
action
: `listener_remove`

mount
: the mountpoint

server
: the server name (`<hostname>`)

port
: the server port

user
: user as stated in listener HTTP basic auth  
  _May be blank_

pass
: pass as stated in listener HTTP basic auth
  _May be blank_

client
: unique ID for the client within Icecast

ip
: listeners IP address

agent
: useragent from the listeners player

duration
: number of seconds the listener was connected for

### Example
`action=listener_remove&server=icecast.example.org&port=8000&client=1&mount=/live&user=&pass=&duration=3600&ip=127.0.0.1&agent=My%20player`


## stream_auth
Technically this does not belong to listener authentication, but due to its similarity it is explained here too.  
When a source connects, before anything is sent back to them, this request is processed. The default action is to
reject a source unless the auth server sends back a response header which may be stated in the `header` option.

### POST Details
action
: `stream_auth`

mount
: the mountpoint

server
: hostname of the Icecast server the client tries to connect to

port
: the port of said server

user
: username as sent by the source client

pass
: password as sent by the source client

admin
: admin request (read below)

__Note:__ As admin requests can come in for a stream (eg. metadata update) these requests can be issued while
stream is active. For these `admin` is set to `1` in POST details.

### Example
`action=stream_auth&mount=/stream.ogg&ip=192.0.2.0&server=icecast.example.org&port=8000&user=source&pass=password&admin=1`


## Other Options

auth_header
: The expected response header to be returned that allows the authencation to take place may be specified here.  
  The default is:  
  `icecast-auth-user: 1`  
  but it could be anything you like, for instance:  
  `HTTP 200 OK`

timelimit_header
: Listeners could have a time limit imposed on them, and if this header is sent back with a figure (which represents seconds)
  then that is how long the client will remain connected for.

headers
: This is a list of HTTP headers provided by the client which should be passed to the authencation service.
  Those headers are prepended by the value of header_prefix and sent as POST parameters.

header_prefix
: This is the prefix used for passing client headers. See headers for details.

# A note about players and authentication
We do not have an exaustive list of players that support listener authentication.  
We use standard HTTP basic authentication, and in general, many media players support this if they support anything at all.
Winamp and Foobar2000 support HTTP basic authentication on Windows, and XMMS supports it on UNIX platforms. Winamp/XMMS at
least support the passing of query parameters, other players may also do.

# Source Authentication
Source authentication is a feature of Icecast which allows you to secure a certain mountpoint such that in order to stream to it,
a source client must pass some verification test. This section will show you the basics of setting up and maintaining this component.  
To define source authentication, a group of tags are specified in the `<mount>` group relating to the mountpoint.  
  
The following authentication mechanisms can apply to sources:

*   BASIC: `<password>` and possibly `<username>` in the `<mount>` section
*   URL: issue web requests (eg. PHP) to match authentication

## URL authentication: `stream_auth`
A `<mount>` can contain a section `<authentication type="url">` and therein
`<option name="stream_auth" value="http://auth.example.org/source.php"/>`. When a source connects, before anything is sent back to
them, this request is processed. The default action is to reject a source unless the auth server sends back a response header which may
be stated in the `header` option (same as listener auth).  

### POST Details
action
: `stream_auth`

mount
: the mountpoint

server
: hostname of the Icecast server the client tries to connect to

port
: the port of said server

user
: username as sent by the source client

pass
: password as sent by the source client

admin
: admin request (read below)

__Note:__ As admin requests can come in for a stream (eg. metadata update) these requests can be issued while
stream is active. For these `admin` is set to `1` in POST details.

### Example
`action=stream_auth&mount=/stream.ogg&ip=192.0.2.0&server=icecast.example.org&port=8000&user=source&pass=password&admin=1`
