  <p>This section contains server level settings that, in general, do not need to be changed.
Only modify this section if you know what you are doing.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>clients</dt>
    <dd>Total number of concurrent clients supported by the server. Listeners are considered clients,
but so are accesses to any static content (i.e. fileserved content) and also any requests to
gather stats. These are max concurrent connections for the entire server (not per mountpoint).</dd>
    <dt>sources</dt>
    <dd>Maximum number of connected sources supported by the server. This includes active relays and source clients</dd>
    <dt>threadpool</dt>
    <dd>This is the number of threads that are started to handle client connections. You may need to
increase this value if you are running a high traffic stream. This recommended value is for a
small to medium traffic server.</dd>
    <dt>queue-size</dt>
    <dd>This is the maximum size (in bytes) of the stream queue. A listener may temporarily
lag behind due to network congestion and in this case an internal queue is maintained for the
listeners. If the queue grows larger than this config value, then it is truncated and any listeners
found will be removed from the stream. This will be the default setting for the streams which is
512k unless overridden here. You can override this in the individual mount settings which can be
useful if you have a mixture of high bandwidth video and low bitrate audio streams.</dd>
    <dt>client-timeout</dt>
    <dd>This does not seem to be used.</dd>
    <dt>header-timeout</dt>
    <dd>The maximum time (in seconds) to wait for a request to come in once the client has made a connection
to the server. In general this value should not need to be tweaked.</dd>
    <dt>source-timeout</dt>
    <dd>If a connected source does not send any data within this timeout period (in seconds),
then the source connection will be removed from the server.</dd>
    <dt>burst-on-connect</dt>
    <dd>With this enabled, a connecting client will be sent a burst of audio data from the stream.
This will have the effect of reducing the startup time for the stream from the perspective of the listener. This is due to the fact that most media players have local buffers that must be filled before the stream begins to play. This may introduce a small latency in the stream (difference in time between when the source plays a clip and the listener hears a clip). If this latency is important to you, then you can disable this feature. The latency is bitrate-dependent, but as an example, for a 128kbps stream, the latency between the source and the player is ~ 1.5 secs <strong>without</strong> burst on connect, and <strong>with</strong> burst on connect the latency is 3 secs.</dd>
    <dt>burst-size</dt>
    <dd>The burst size is the amount of data (in bytes) to burst to a client at connection time. Like burst-on-connect,
this is to quickly fill the pre-buffer used by media players. The default is 64 kbytes which is a typical size used by most clients so changing it is not usually required. This setting applies to all mountpoints.</dd>

  <p>This section contains all the usernames and passwords used for administration purposes or to connect sources and relays.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>source-password</dt>
    <dd>The unencrypted password used by sources to connect to Icecast. The default username for all 
source connections is ‘source’ but this option allows to specify a default password. This and the
username can be changed in the individual mount sections.</dd>
    <dt>relay-user</dt>
    <dd>Used in the master server as part of the authentication when a slave requests the list of streams
to relay. The default username is <code>relay</code></dd>
    <dt>relay-password</dt>
    <dd>Used in the master server as part of the authentication when a slave requests the list of streams to relay.</dd>
    <dt>admin-user/admin-password</dt>

  <p>This section contains miscellaneous server settings. Note that multiple listen-socket sections may be configured in order to have icecast2 listen on multiple network interfaces. If a bind-address is not specified for a particular listen-socket, then the socket will be bound to all interfaces. Generally, you won’t need to set bind-address. There is an internal limit of 20 listening sockets currently, which may be extended in later releases.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>port</dt>
    <dd>The TCP port that will be used to accept client connections.</dd>
    <dt>bind-address</dt>
    <dd>An optional IP address that can be used to bind to a specific network card. If not supplied, then it will bind to all interfaces.</dd>
    <dt>shoutcast-compat</dt>
    <dd>This optional flag will indicate that this port will operate in ‘shoutcast-compatibility’ mode. Due to major differences in the source client connection protocol, if you wish to use any of the shoutcast DJ tools, you will need to configure at least one socket as shoutcast-compatible. Note that when in this mode, only source clients (and specifically shoutcast source clients) will be able to attach to this port. All listeners may connect to any of the ports defined without this flag. Also, for proper Shoutcast DSP compatibility, you must define a listen socket with a port one less than the one defined as ‘shoutcast-compat’. This means if you define 8001 as shoutcast-compat, then you will need to define a listen port of 8000 and it must not also be defined as shoutcast-compat. See the example config file in the distribution for more info.</dd>
    <dt>fileserve</dt>
    <dd>This flag turns on the icecast2 fileserver from which static files can be served. All files are served relative to the path specified in the <code>&lt;paths&gt;&lt;webroot&gt;</code> configuration setting.</dd>
    <dt>shoutcast-mount</dt>
    <dd>An optional mountpoint to use when shoutcast DSP compatible clients connect. The default is /stream but can be overridden here to use an alternative name which may include an extension that some clients require for certain formats.</dd>

  <p>This section contains the server’s relay settings. There are two types of relays: a “Master server relay” or a “Specific Mountpoint relay.” A Master server relay is only supported between icecast2 servers and is used to relays all mountpoints on a remote icecast2 server.  </p>

  <h4>Master Relay</h4>

  <p>The following diagram shows the basics of doing a Master relay. Note that Server 1 is configured with the <code>&lt;master-server&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;master-server-port&gt;</code>, etc settings and Server 2 is the server from which Server 1 will pull all attached mountpoints and relay them. Using a Master Server relay, ALL mountpoints on Server 2 will be relayed. If only specific mountpoints need to be relayed, then you must configure Server 1 as a “Specific Mountpoint Relay”. Both Master server relays and Specific Mountpoint relays begin their “relaying” when the Server is started.</p>

      Server 1                      Server 2
      (RELAY SERVER)                (MASTER SERVER)

     configured with
     &lt;master-server&gt;
     settings
</pre>

  <p>A server is configured as a Master Server relay by specifying the <code>&lt;master-server&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;master-server-port&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;master-update-interval&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;master-password&gt;</code> values in the config file. The server that is being relayed does not need any special configuration.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>master-server</dt>
    <dd>This is the IP for the server which contains the mountpoints to be relayed (Master Server).</dd>
    <dt>master-server-port</dt>
    <dd>This is the TCP Port for the server which contains the mountpoints to be relayed (Master Server).</dd>
    <dt>master-update-interval</dt>
    <dd>The interval (in seconds) that the Relay Server will poll the Master Server for any new mountpoints to relay.</dd>
    <dt>master-username</dt>
    <dd>This is the relay username on the master server. It is used to query the server for a list of mountpoints to
relay. If not specified then <code>relay</code> is used.</dd>
    <dt>master-password</dt>
    <dd>This is the relay password on the Master server. It is used to query the server for a list of mountpoints to
relay.</dd>
    <dt>relays-on-demand</dt>
    <dd>Changes the default on-demand setting for relays, so a stream is only relayed if listeners are connected. 1=enabled, 0=disabled (default).  </dd>
  </dl>

  <h4>Specific Mountpoint Relay</h4>

  <p>The following diagram shows the basics of doing a Specific Mountpoint relay. Note that Server 1 is configured with the <code>&lt;relay&gt;</code> settings and Server 2 is the server from which Server 1 will pull the specified mountpoint(s) and relay them. Using a Specific Mountpoint Relay, only those mountpoints specified on Server 1 will be relayed from Server 2.</p>

  <pre>
      |-----|                       |-----|
      |     |      /mount3          |     | /mount1
      |     | &lt;-------------------  |     | /mount2.ogg
      |-----|                       |-----| /mount3
      Icecast 2                     Icecast 2/Shoutcast/Icecast
      Server 1                      Server 2
      (RELAY SERVER)                (REMOTE SERVER)

     configured with
     &lt;relay&gt;
     settings
</pre>

  <p>Specific Mountpoint Relays can be configured to relay from an Icecast 2 server, as well as Icecast 1.x and Shoutcast.
A server is configured as a Specific Mountpoint Server relay by specifying a <code>&lt;relay&gt;</code> XML chunk in the config file
for each mountpoint to be relayed. The server that is being relayed does not need any special configuration.</p>

  <p>This section contains the settings which apply only to a specific mountpoint and applies to an incoming
stream whether it is a relay or a source client. The purpose of the mount definition is to state certain
information that can override either global/default settings or settings provided from the incoming stream.</p>

  <p>A mount does not need to be stated for each incoming source although you may want to specific certain settings
like the maximum number of listeners or a mountpoint specific username/password. As a general rule, only define
what you need to but each mount definition needs at least the mount-name. Changes to most of these will apply
across a configuration file re-read even on active streams, however some only apply when the stream starts or
ends.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>mount-name</dt>
    <dd>The name of the mount point for which these settings apply.</dd>
    <dt>username</dt>
    <dd>An optional value which will set the username that a source must use to connect using this mountpoint.</dd>
    <dt>password</dt>
    <dd>An optional value which will set the password that a source must use to connect using this mountpoint.</dd>
    <dt>max-listeners</dt>
    <dd>An optional value which will set the maximum number of listeners that can be attached to this mountpoint.</dd>
    <dt>max-listener-duration</dt>
    <dd>An optional value which will set the length of time a listener will stay connected to the stream.<br />
An auth component may override this.</dd>
    <dt>dump-file</dt>
    <dd>An optional value which will set the filename which will be a dump of the stream coming through 
on this mountpoint.</dd>
    <dt>intro</dt>
    <dd>An optional value which will specify the file those contents will be sent to new listeners when they
connect but before the normal stream is sent. Make sure the format of the file specified matches the
streaming format. The specified file is appended to webroot before being opened.</dd>
    <dt>fallback-mount</dt>
    <dd>This optional value specifies a mountpoint that clients are automatically moved
to if the source shuts down or is not streaming at the time a listener connects. Only one can be
listed in each mount and should refer to another mountpoint on the same server that is streaming in
the same streaming format.<br />
If clients cannot fallback to another mountpoint, due to a missing
fallback-mount or it states a mountpoint that is just not available, then those clients will be
disconnected. If clients are falling back to a mountpoint and the fallback-mount is not actively
streaming but defines a fallback-mount itself then those clients may be moved there instead. This
multi-level fallback allows clients to cascade several mountpoints.<br />
A fallback mount can also state a file that is located in webroot. This is useful for playing a
pre-recorded file in the case of a stream going down. It will repeat until either the listener
disconnects or a stream comes back available and takes the listeners back. As per usual, the file
format should match the stream format, failing to do so may cause problems with playback.<br />
Note that the fallback file is not timed so be careful if you intend to relay this. They are fine
on slave streams but don’t use them on master streams, if you do then the relay will consume stream
data at a faster rate and the listeners on the relay would eventually get kicked off.</dd>
    <dt>fallback-override</dt>
    <dd>When enabled, this allows a connecting source client or relay on this mountpoint to move listening
clients back from the fallback mount.</dd>
    <dt>fallback-when-full</dt>
    <dd>When set to <code>1</code>, this will cause new listeners, when the max listener count for the mountpoint has
been reached, to move to the fallback mount if there is one specified.</dd>
    <dt><del>no-yp</del> (deprecated)</dt>
    <dd>Setting this option prevents this mountpoint from advertising on YP. The default is <code>0</code> so YP advertising
can occur however you may want to prevent it here if you intend listeners to connect to a local relay instead.<br />
Deprecated option, replaced by <code>&lt;public&gt;</code></dd>
    <dt>public</dt>
    <dd>The default setting for this is <code>-1</code> indicating that it is up to the source client or relay to determine if this mountpoint
should advertise. A setting of <code>0</code> will prevent any advertising and a setting of <code>1</code> will force it to advertise. 
If you do force advertising you may need to set other settings listed below as the YP server can refuse to advertise
if there is not enough information provided.</dd>
    <dt>stream-name</dt>
    <dd>Setting this will add the specified name to the stats (and therefore YP) for this mountpoint even if the source client/relay provide one.</dd>
    <dt>stream-description</dt>
    <dd>Setting this will add the specified description to the stats (and therefore YP) for this mountpoint even if the source client/relay provide one.</dd>
    <dt>stream-url</dt>
    <dd>Setting this will add the specified URL to the stats (and therefore YP) for this mountpoint even if the source client/relay provide one.<br />
The URL is generally for directing people to a website.</dd>
    <dt>genre</dt>
    <dd>Setting this will add the specified genre to the stats (and therefore YP) for this mountpoint even if the source client/relay provide one.<br />
This can be anything be using certain key words can help searches in the YP directories.</dd>
    <dt>bitrate</dt>
    <dd>Setting this will add the specified bitrate to the stats (and therefore YP) for this mountpoint even if the source client/relay provide one.<br />
This is stated in kbps.</dd>
    <dt>type</dt>
    <dd>Setting this will add the specified mime type to the stats (and therefore YP) for this mountpoint even if the source client/relay provide one.<br />
It is very unlikely that this will be needed.</dd>
    <dt>subtype</dt>
    <dd>Setting this will add the specified subtype to the stats (and therefore YP) for this mountpoint.
The subtype is really to help the YP server to identify the components of the type.
An example setting is vorbis/theora do indicate the codecs in an Ogg stream</dd>
    <dt>burst-size</dt>
    <dd>This optional setting allows for providing a burst size which overrides the default burst size as defined in limits.<br />
The value is in bytes.</dd>
    <dt>mp3-metadata-interval</dt>
    <dd>This optional setting specifies what interval, in bytes, there is between metadata updates within shoutcast compatible streams.
This only applies to new listeners connecting on this mountpoint, not existing listeners falling back to this mountpoint. The
default is either the hardcoded server default or the value passed from a relay.</dd>
    <dt>hidden</dt>
    <dd>Enable this to prevent this mount from being shown on the xsl pages. This is mainly for cases where a local relay is configured
and you do not want the source of the local relay to be shown.</dd>
    <dt>authentication</dt>
    <dd>This specifies that the named mount point will require listener authentication. Currently, we support a file-based
authentication scheme (<code>type=htpasswd</code>).<br />
Users and encrypted password are placed in this file (separated by a <code>:</code>) and all requests for this mountpoint will require that a user and password be supplied for authentication purposes. These values are passed in via normal HTTP Basic Authentication means (i.e. <code>http://user:password@stream:port/mountpoint.ogg</code>). Users and Passwords are maintained via the web admin interface. A mountpoint configured with an authenticator will display a red key next to the mount point name on the admin screens. You can read more about listener authentication <a href="auth.html">here</a>.</dd>
    <dt>on-connect</dt>
    <dd>State a program that is run when the source is started. It is passed a parameter which is the name of the mountpoint that is starting.
The processing of the stream does not wait for the script to end.<br />
<em>This option is not available on Win32</em></dd>
    <dt>on-disconnect</dt>
    <dd>State a program that is run when the source ends. It is passed a parameter which is the name of the mountpoint that has ended.
The processing of the stream does not wait for the script to end.<br />
<em>This option is not available on Win32</em></dd>

  <p>This section contains paths which are used for various things within icecast. All paths (other than any aliases) should not end in a <code>/</code>.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>basedir</dt>
    <dd>This path is used in conjunction with the chroot settings, and specified the base directory that is chrooted to when the server is started.<br />
<em>This feature is not supported on Win32.</em></dd>
    <dt>logdir</dt>
    <dd>This path specifies the base directory used for logging. Both the <code>error.log</code> and <code>access.log</code> will be created relative to this directory.</dd>
    <dt>pidfile</dt>
    <dd>This pathname specifies the file to write at startup and to remove at normal shutdown. The file contains the process id of the icecast process.<br />
This could be read and used for sending signals to Icecast.</dd>
    <dt>webroot</dt>
    <dd>This path specifies the base directory used for all static file requests. This directory can contain all standard file types
(including mp3s and ogg vorbis files). For example, if webroot is set to <code>/var/share/icecast2</code>, and a request for
<code>http://server:port/mp3/stuff.mp3</code> comes in, then the file <code>/var/share/icecast2/mp3/stuff.mp3</code> will be served.</dd>
    <dt>adminroot</dt>
    <dd>This path specifies the base directory used for all admin requests. More specifically, this is used to hold the XSLT scripts used
for the web-based admin interface. The admin directory contained within the icecast distribution contains these files.</dd>
    <dt>alias</dt>
    <dd>Aliases are used to provide a way to create multiple mountpoints that refer to the same mountpoint.<br />
For example: <code>&lt;alias source="/foo" dest="/bar"&gt;</code></dd>

<span class="nt">&lt;/logging&gt;</span></code></pre></div>

  <p>This section contains information relating to logging within Icecast. There are two logfiles currently generated by Icecast,
an <code>error.log</code> (where all log messages are placed), and an <code>access.log</code> (where all stream/admin/http requests are logged).  </p>

  <p>Note that on non-win32 platforms, a HUP signal can be sent to Icecast in which the log files are re-opened for appending giving the ability move/remove the log files.  </p>

  <dl>
    <dt>accesslog</dt>
    <dd>Into this file, all requests made to the icecast2 will be logged. This file is relative to the path specified by the <code>&lt;logdir&gt;</code> config value.</dd>
    <dt>errorlog</dt>
    <dd>All Icecast generated log messages will be written to this file. If the loglevel is set too high (Debug for instance) then
this file can grow fairly large over time. Currently, there is no log-rotation implemented.</dd>
    <dt>playlistlog</dt>
    <dd>Into this file, a log of all metadata for each mountpoint will be written. The format of the logfile will most likely change over time
as we narrow in on a standard format for this. Currently, the file is pipe delimited. This option is optional and can be removed entirely
from the config file.</dd>
    <dt>logsize</dt>
    <dd>This value specifies (in Kbytes) the maxmimum size of any of the log files. When the logfile grows beyond this value, icecast will either
rename it to <code>logfile.old</code>, or add a timestamp to the archived file (if logarchive is enabled).</dd>
    <dt>logarchive</dt>
    <dd>If this value is set, then Icecast will append a timestamp to the end of the logfile name when logsize has been reached. If disabled, then
the default behavior is to rename the logfile to <code>logfile.old</code> (overwriting any previously saved logfiles). We disable this by default to
prevent the filling up of filesystems for people who don’t care (or know) that their logs are growing.</dd>
    <dt>loglevel</dt>
    <dd>Indicates what messages are logged by icecast. Log messages are categorized into one of 4 types, Debug, Info, Warn, and Error.<br />

      <p>The following mapping can be used to set the appropraite value:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>loglevel = <code>4</code>: Debug, Info, Warn, Error messages are printed</li>
        <li>loglevel = <code>3</code>: Info, Warn, Error messages are printed</li>
        <li>loglevel = <code>2</code>: Warn, Error messages are printed</li>
        <li>loglevel = <code>1</code>: Error messages only are printed</li>
