# Bugs and Features

## Reporting bugs

If you find a bug in Icecast, you can report it on our [Bugtracker](https://trac.xiph.org/newticket) (make sure it's not a duplicate).

Please make sure that you include all necessary information for us to reproduce the bug and describe it as
good a possible. If relevant please attach the `error.log` and your `icecast.xml` (without passwords), so we
can make sure it is not a configuration problem.

If you are unsure if you found a bug or not, or you don't want to open a ticket on our Bugtracker, you can
send us an e-mail to our [icecast-dev](/contact#mailing-list) mailinglist, but please subscribe first.

## Requesting features

If you thing that a feature should be added to Icecast, you can submit us feature requests by sending them to
the [icecast-dev](/contact#mailing-list) mailinglist (subscribe first). Please make sure that your feature is
of general nature and not something that only you might need.

# Development

You can contribute to the Icecast development by sending us patches that fix bugs or implement new features. Note that
new features should be discussed before you start working on them (read above).  
You can either send us patches through the [Bugtracker](https://trac.xiph.org/newticket), just create a ticket that describes what your patchs adds/fixes and
attach the patch to it.  
If you prefer you can also send us the patch to our [icecast-dev](/contact#mailing-list) mailinglist.

## Guidelines for patches
When submitting patches, you should send a separate patch for each bugfix/feature and follow the [Icecast code-style guide](/contribute/codestyle.html).

## GitHub Pull Requests
While we have a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/xiph/Icecast-Server) and it is possible to send us pull requests there, it may take a long time until we notice them, since GitHub is just used as a mirror. Therefore we strongly advise that you send us your patches as a Bugtracker ticket attachment or on the mailinglist.
